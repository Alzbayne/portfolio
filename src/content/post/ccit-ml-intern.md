## Overview

During my internship at FAITH College of Computing and Information Technology, I dove into the world of machine learning by building a real-time leaf identification system. This hands-on project gave me a chance to train object detection models, tune hyperparameters, and use essential libraries for deploying models.

## What I Did

- Collected and organized datasets for training
- Preprocessed images to ensure quality data
- Trained and optimized deep learning models (including exploring GroundingDino)
- Analyzed model accuracy and performance metrics
- Documented research findings and contributed to academic reports

## Skills Gained

- **Machine Learning Development:** Improved my skills in model training, data preprocessing, and experimenting with different architectures and optimization techniques.
- **Research:** Explored new algorithms and technologies, and learned how to transition from research to practical application.
- **Teamwork:** Worked with a team of 21 students, sharing ideas and solving problems together.
- **Time Management:** Met deadlines for data processing, model training, and evaluations.
- **Communication:** Regularly discussed progress and challenges with peers and project leads.

## Personal Growth

This internship helped me become more proactive and adaptable. I took on extra tasks, explored new tech, and suggested improvements for the Snapfolia model. My curiosity and willingness to learn earned positive feedback from my team.
