## Overview

My internship at Valenin IT Services was all about hands-on DevOps, cloud deployments, and working with a collaborative team. I got to experience tools like Bitbucket, Cloudways, Docker, and Nginx, and even tackled some production-level technical issues.

## What I Did

- Managed deployments and monitored cloud environments
- Used Bitbucket for version control and Cloudways for scalable hosting
- Worked with Docker and Nginx for containerization and web server management
- Drafted deployment documentation for web projects
- Troubleshot live server issues and security errors

## Skills Gained

- **DevOps & Technical Operations:** Learned to deploy and manage apps using Valeninâ€™s tech stack, and wrote clear documentation for reproducible workflows.
- **Adaptability:** Explored frameworks like Node.js and CodeIgniter 4, and balanced multiple tasks efficiently.
- **Problem Solving:** Applied theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges, from server misconfigurations to security fixes.

## Personal Growth

This OJT was a great chance to build initiative, reliability, and independence. I improved my communication by actively listening, sharing updates, and collaborating with the team. My confidence in both verbal and written communication grew a lot.
